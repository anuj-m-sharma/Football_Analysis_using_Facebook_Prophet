# Football_Analysis_using_Facebook_Prophet

I  used 'Facebook Prophet' in order to predict whether NFL kickers will make or miss more kicks as the season progresses. This is being analysed  because the football season starts in August, and ends in February. Between August and January, the temperature drops a lot and inclement weather becomes more prevalent so we want to see if the weather is statistically more of a factor - especially with a lot of NFL teams playing in colder areas of the country up north and out west every week. Facebook prophet is used to predict whether kickers will be more likely to miss or make more kicks in January and February by using the data we have of all of the field goals made from August to December. From our models, we find that the ratio of made field goals to missed field goals only slightly increases throughout the season. From August to December, there seems to only be a .5% increase in the ratio of made field goals to missed field goals. Although there were no correlation between the change in seasons/change in weather and the ratio of made field goals to missed field goals, I learnt how to predict what the ratio will likely be for the future using data from what has already happened with Facebook Prophet.
